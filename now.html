      <h1>What I'm doing right <code>/now</code></h1>
      <h4>Moving</h4>
      <p>I moved from Scotland to Berlin a few months ago. Moving from Scotland to Berlin is like fast-forwarding 1000 years in time. I was prepared to dislike the city because I'm not very cool, but it really is fantastic here, and there is so much to do.</p>
      <h4>German Classes</h4>
      <p>I spent the first few months in Germany convinced I was going to learn the language though osmosis by watching TV. I gave in, and now I'm in an intensive language course four days a week. One thing that has solidified for me during this process is knowing <i>how</i> to learn a language is just as important of a skill as the language itself. The deep deep agony I went though learning other languages has made this one fun and relatively painless.</p>

      <h4>Rock Climbing</h4>
      <p>I'm a cliche! It is an extemely addicting sport. I never thought I could be good at a sport with such an upper body focus. I'm also scared of heights, my head starts to spin 10ft up. But, it's been rewarding conquering my fears and getting ripped in the process.</p>
      <h4>Work Vibes</h4>
      <p>Feeling very mid-career. Every day I realize more and more how much I don't know. I've been enjoying focusing on the details.</p>

      <h4>printer_scanner</h4>
      <p>Is unfortunately a little bit on the back burner. I've been a bit busy getting acclimated, but I'm hoping in the fall things will slow down.</p>
