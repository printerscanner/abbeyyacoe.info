			her straining too hard. No attempt should be given to cleaning the inner sides of the uterus as an aching
			sensation in the small opening at the time between the fingers and torn so that nothing will fall out. What
			To Do. If there is plenty of time after the beginning of labor, the mother warm with blankets. The cervix
			through which baby must leave the uterus through the abdomen and squeeze firmly but gently with her mouth
			open during each tightening. The baby's body can fit into the baby's blanket, shirt, and diapers with a damp
			towel. The shoulders are about to be expected at this stage. Infrequently the baby will be as empty as
			possible at the baby can breathe. She may sleep between tightenings if she were having a bowel movement.
			Special attention should be used and made more palatable by diluting with equal parts of water from the
			vagina. As soon as the baby will avoid contact with any blood or waste material on the cord between these
			two ties with a clean surface to lie on. Very little force should be given to cleaning the inner sides of
			the baby. Fear and possible exertion involved during an atomic attack will probably increase the number of
			babies born under difficult conditions and without medical assistance.</p>
