		<h2>The Western Canon</h2>
			<p>The reason this all started was because I didn't read The Iliad in college. I took a course on literature pre-500 AD, and had the crustiest old professor. He was exactly Such a reader does not read for easy pleasure or to expiate social guilt but to enlarge a solitary existence. - Harold Bloom</p>

			<p>If you want to read your way through the classics, there is nothing preliminary you need to read to get started. Just dive right in. I read these books to get a better understanding of what's chosen as a canonical work and why. If you're new and are looking for a gentle introduction to ideas of The Western Canons, I would recommend starting with Denby's <a href="books/great-books.html">Great Books</a>.</p>

			<p>Harold Bloom was an American professor, literary critic and controversial defender of the Western canon. In the 21st century, to talk about the canon is to talk about Bloom. His book, however, is not for the everyday reader. You will probably get the most out of The Western Canon if you've already read all of the books he talks about.</p>

			<p>If you don't have five years to spare, there are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ieF7LVbyI&ab_channel=ManufacturingIntellect">YouTube videos</a> where he talks generally about his ideas of the concept of the canon.</p>

			<p>The Western Canon is the collection of books considered to be essential in the Western world. There is much debate over what texts should be included in the canon, and if it's existence is both arbitrary and exclusionary. For Harold Bloom, suspects including Homer, Dante, Shakespeare and Milton hold a quantifiable aesthetic superiority. He does recognize that there are inequalities of representation within the canon, but that to change is political activism that only threatens the Humanities.</p>

			<p>His definition of a canonical work is one that is most essential for scholastic study by young students. He wants to ensure that students of literary studies read works of highest aesthetic excellence.  Bloom asks the same question every reader asks. What is important to read in our short lives? Fundamentally, Bloom wants the same thing as us, to spend the precious moments of our lives with the books that will most thoroughly enrich it.</p>
