		<h2>Women of Troy</h2>
			<p>Feminists eat your heart out. This is described as the first anti-war poem. Euripides describes the plights of those affected by the battle of Troy, the war that takes place in the Iliad. Specifically, the woman who suffered needlessly as a result of menâ€™s rage. I picked this book up in a charity shop down the street from my house and read it in about 15 minutes.</p>
