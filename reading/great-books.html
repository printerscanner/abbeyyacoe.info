		<h2>Great Books</h2>
			<p>If you're interested in reading the classics and don't know where to start, reading this book is a gentle introduction. Denby is a middle-aged movie critic that returns to Columbia University to revisit the first-year literature and humanities curriculum, and re-read the classic books assigned to Freshman. He's the kind of man who thinks he came to himself "in a dark wood where the straight way was lost," but really, it's just a mid-life crisis. You'll hate him for it.</p>

			<p>What he'll remind you is, w*e're here for selfish reasons.* When you're reading anything, especially something old, take the part of you that engages with society and leave it on the shelf. Reading is ultimately a solitary process and you're meant to engage only with yourself. At the beginning, it's hard to reconcile that these books could have value in anything other than being dusty if we don't place them in society. But, we don't inherit our ideas, and neither do the books we read.</p>

			<p>Read this book. Hate him. Write a negative review on his Amazon page because I was too chicken.</p>
