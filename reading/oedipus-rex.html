		<h2>Oedipus Rex</h2>
			<p>Oedipus Rex was different from what I was expecting. I could say that about every text, as all these stories have changed through the retellings I've encountered and half-listened to. Oedipus Rex is translated from Freud to my ears. 'He killed his father and buried his mother'. But the real play, it's horror. Oedipus watches as the events unfold in front of him. He's powerless to stop the events of the play from playing out. Yet, he's blameless. He didn't know.</p>

			<p>Freud writes about the play "His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours â€” because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him. It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father. Our dreams convince us that this is so." Love Freud, he's so crazy. Absolutely crazy interpretation of the play, but it makes me feel better about my weird, weird ideas.</p>
