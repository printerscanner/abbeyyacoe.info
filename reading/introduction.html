		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Two years ago, I started this document to organize my reading. The list started as about 20 classic novels that I had always wanted to read and never had time for. Since then, it has expanded into the behemoth we see today. I'm hoping to write short articles about each text, and what I got out of reading it. If you click into a completed book and see a blank page, that means I haven't written anything yet.</p>

			<p>Wherever possible, I linked PDF copies of the texts. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is an excellent resource for public domain books. If you're comfortable with a terminal, I created a <a href="https://github.com/abbeyyacoe/gutenberg-script">bash script</a> that downloads and organizes files from the Project Gutenberg.</p>

			<p>I hope this can be of some interest to you. Two years in, this project sincerely changed my life and my thinking. If you are interested in learning more or have any comments or suggestions, please send me an email at: <a href="mailto:abbeyyacoe@gmail.com">abbeyyacoe@gmail.com</a>.</p>
