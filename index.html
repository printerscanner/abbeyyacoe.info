		<p>Hey, I'm Abbey <span role="img" aria-label="wave">ðŸ‘‹.</span> I'm a software developer and graphic designer
			from San Francisco, California.</p>

		<p>I started programming in high school through web design courses at <a
				href="https://freestyleacademy.rocks/">Freestyle Academy</a>. In college, I studied English at <a
				href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>. Then, I moved back to San Francisco,
			where I worked as a software development intern at a data identification startup called <a
				href="https://parrable.com">Parrable</a> and took night school classes in computer science. Then, I
			worked as an art director at a advertising agency called <a href="https://wearexyz.com">XYZ</a>. After a few
			years, I moved out to the desert of Tucson, Arizona to work as a software engineer for the Education &
			Public Outreach team at the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a>. Recently, I
			studied communication design at <a href="https://paris.edu">Paris College of Art</a> in Paris.</p>

		<p>Right now, I am in Edinburgh, where </span> it's <span id="current_time"></span> and a beautiful <span
				id="temperature"></span>Â°F with <span id="description"></span>. I'm probably <span id="message"></span>
			if you're trying to reach me. You can get in touch at <a
				href="mailto:abbeyyacoe@gmail.com">abbeyyacoe@gmail.com</a> or find me on <a
				href="https://github.com/printerscanner">Github</a>.</p>

		<p>In the design world, I am working on a project called <a href="https://printerscanner.net">printer_scanner</a>, where I design, print and bind art books and other printed (or scanned) matter. Some projects I am most proud of are <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/polygons">Polygons<a>, a book that details all convex and star polygons up to 28 edges, <a
				href="https://printerscanner.net/work/april">April</a>, a borderless photo book dedicated to spring, and a pamphlet I wrote
			on <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/random_number_generators">pseudorandom number generators</a>.
			You
			can find printer_scanner on <a href="https://instagram.com/printer_scanner">Instagram</a> or on <a
				href="https://www.behance.net/printerscanner">Behance</a>.</p>

		<p>Other projects I am proud of include <a href="https://github.com/printerscanner/slightly-better-css">Slightly
				Better CSS</a>, a lightweight
			(2KB) CSS stylesheet for people with taste, the <a href="https://instagram.com/mondrian_generator">Mondrian
				Generator</a>, a program that randomly
			generates Mondrian lookalikes and posts them on Instagram, <a
				href="https://twitter.com/Roch_Bot">Rochefoucauld Twitter Bot</a>, which tweets out the maxims of the
			17th Century French moralist, and my <a
				href="https://printerscanner.github.io/learn-hex-color-codes/">Hex Code
				Guide</a>, a small website helps people understand the relationship between hexadecimal numbers and the
			RGB color space.</p>


		<p>Here, Iâ€™ve made a <a href="library">library</a> of books and pdf's I've collected over the years available.
			You can use <a
				href="https://superuser.com/questions/655554/download-all-folders-subfolders-and-files-using-wget">wget</a>
			to grab them all. I also have a collection of <a
				href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/e740a78962ba412cb74fc4bcd620f143?v=88adab5d5b3346b2a33ed33502d5f4b5">design
				resources</a> I've compiled that I often refer to. If you're looking to get into programming, I have a
			small group of <a
				href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/Programming-Resources-16d706b5feab48d48c03004575222396">programming
				guides</a> that Iâ€™ve found valuable.</p>

		<p>Outside of computing, I've spent the last couple of years working my way through the classics and have a <a
				href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/Books-ab205628aed1465dbfe6383dabd76c31">notion page</a> where
			I share
			what I'm reading.
			I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCam9p5fiexMSluubYBs6sNw">YouTube channel</a> where I
			document my world travels. If you've read all this and are itching to see more, feel free to check out the
			<a href="https://printerscanner.net/archive">Archive</a>, where I post other small projects not mentioned
			here.</p>
