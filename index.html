      <p>Hey, I'm Abbey <span role="img" aria-label="wave">ðŸ‘‹.</span> I'm a software developer and graphic designer from San Francisco, California. </p>

      <p>I started programming in high school through web design courses at <a href="https://freestyleacademy.rocks/">Freestyle Academy</a>. I studied English at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, then moved back to San Francisco, where I worked as a software development intern at a data identification startup called <a href="https://parrable.com">Parrable</a> and took night school classes in computer science. Then, I worked as an art director at an advertising agency called <a href="https://wearexyz.com">XYZ</a>. After a few years, I moved out to the desert of Tucson, Arizona, to work as a software engineer at the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Rubin Observatory</a>. Recently, I studied communication design at <a href="https://paris.edu">Paris College of Art</a> in Paris.</p>

    <p>Right now, I am in Edinburgh, where </span> it's <span id="current_time"></span> and a beautiful <span id="temperature"></span>Â°F with <span id="description"></span>. I'm working as a UX Engineer at <a href="https://fictivekin.com">Fictive Kin</a>, and I'm probably <span id="message"></span> if you're trying to reach me. You can get in touch at <a href="mailto:abbeyyacoe@gmail.com">abbeyyacoe@gmail.com</a> or find me on <a href="https://github.com/printerscanner">Github</a>. </p>


      <p>In the design world, I am working on a project called <a href="https://printerscanner.net">printer_scanner</a>, where I design, print and bind art books and other printed (or scanned) matter. Some projects I am most proud of are <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/polygons">Polygons<a>, a book that illustrates all convex and star polygons up to 28 edges, <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/april">April</a>, a borderless photo book dedicated to spring, and a pamphlet I wrote on <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/random_number_generators">pseudorandom number generators</a>. You can find printer_scanner on <a href="https://instagram.com/printer_scanner">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.behance.net/printerscanner">Behance</a>. </p>


      <p>Other projects I am proud of include the <a href="https://instagram.com/mondrian_generator">Mondrian Generator</a>, a program that randomly generates Mondrian lookalikes and posts them on Instagram, <a href="https://github.com/printerscanner/slightly-better-css">Slightly Better CSS</a>, a lightweight (2KB) CSS stylesheet for people with taste, and my <a href="https://printerscanner.net/archives/collages">Collage Auto-Generator</a>, a program that makes it's own collage posters, with surprisingly beautiful results.</p>

	  <p>Outside of computing, I've spent the last couple of years working through the classics. I have a <a href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/Books-ab205628aed1465dbfe6383dabd76c31">Notion</a> page where you can follow what I'm reading. Along the way, I collected a few free pdfs and put them in my <a href="library">Library</a>. You can use <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/655554/download-all-folders-subfolders-and-files-using-wget">wget</a> to grab them all.</p>


	<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCam9p5fiexMSluubYBs6sNw">YouTube channel</a> where I document my world travels.</p>
