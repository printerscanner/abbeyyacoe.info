				<p>Hey, I'm Abbey <span role="img" aria-label="wave">ðŸ‘‹.</span> I'm a software developer and graphic designer from San Francisco, California.</p>

				 <p>I started programming in through courses offered at my high school. I studied English at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> in Boston. Then, I moved back to San Francisco, where I worked as a software development intern at a data identification startup called <a href="https://parrable.com">Parrable</a> and took night school classes in computer science. Then, I worked as an art director at a advertising agency called <a href="https://wearexyz.com">XYZ</a>. After a few years, I moved out to the desert of Tucson, Arizona to work as a software engineer for the Education & Public Outreach team at the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</a>. Recently, I studied communication design at the <a href="https://paris.edu">Paris College of Art</a> in Paris.</p>

				<p>I am currently in Edinburgh, where </span> it's <span id="current_time"></span> and a beautiful <span id="temperature"></span>Â°F with <span id="description"></span>.  I'm probably <span id="message"></span> if you're trying to reach me right now. You can get in touch at <a href="mailto:abbeyyacoe@gmail.com">abbeyyacoe@gmail.com</a> or find me on <a href="https://github.com/abbeyyacoe">Github</a>.

				<p>In the design world, to offset my online contributions, I am working on a project called <a href="https://printerscanner.net">printer_scanner</a>. I produce art books and other printed (or scanned) matter. Some projects I am most proud of are <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/randomized_bible">The Randomized Bible</a>, a Bible with all of the verses printed in random order, <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/polygons">Polygons</a>, a book that details all convex and star polygons up to 28 edges, <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/vertues">Of The Vertues Commonly Called The Passions</a>, a work of AI-generated philosophy using Markov Chains, hardback bound by hand, and a pamphlet I wrote on <a href="https://printerscanner.net/work/random_number_generators">random number generators</a>. You can find printer_scanner on <a href="https://instagram.com/printer_scanner">Instagram</a>.</p>

				<p>Other smaller design projects I am proud of include the <a href="https://instagram.com/mondrian_generator">Mondrian Generator</a>, a program that randomly generates Mondrian lookalikes and posts them on Instagram, <a href="https://twitter.com/Roch_Bot">Rochefoucauld Twitter Bot</a>, which tweets out the maxims of the 17th Century French moralist, and my <a href="https://abbeyyacoe.github.io/learn-hex-color-codes/">Hex Code Guide</a>, a small website helps people understand the relationship between hexadecimal numbers and the RGB color space.</p>

				<p>I also produce small procedurally generated blog posts such as <a href="generated-blog/iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.html">iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</a>, <a href="generated-blog/iiiiiiii_but_everytime_it_gets_bigger.html">iiiiiiii - but every time it gets bigger</a>, <a href="generated-blog/moby-dick.html">Moby-Dick - but every line it gets bigger</a>, <a href="generated-blog/expectant-mothers.html">Expectant Mothers, Emergency Childbirth</a> and <a href="generated-blog/learn-js.html">The Fastest Way to Teach Yourself JavaScript</a>.</p>


				<p>Iâ€™ve made a <a href="Resources">Library</a> of documents available here. You can use <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/655554/download-all-folders-subfolders-and-files-using-wget">wget</a> to grab them all. I also have a collection of <a href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/e740a78962ba412cb74fc4bcd620f143?v=88adab5d5b3346b2a33ed33502d5f4b5">design resources</a> I've compiled that I often refer to. If you're looking to get into programming, I have a small group of <a href="https://printer-scanner.notion.site/Programming-Resources-16d706b5feab48d48c03004575222396">programming guides</a> that Iâ€™ve found valuable.</p>

				<p>Outside of computing, I've spent the last couple of years working my way through classic literature and political philosophy and have a small blog called <a href="what-im-reading.html">what I'm reading (*new*)</a>. I also have a <a href="">YouTube channel</a> where I document my world travels. If you've made it through this, you must have a lot of free time. <a id="book_link" href="">Here's something random to read</a>.</p>
